Warning: you are using DPPP, the deprecated name for DP3, to start the program!
In March 2021, the main DP3 executable was renamed to 'DP3' to use one consistent
name. Your parameters are now forwarded to DP3, but this forwarding wrapper will be
removed in the future: update your commands/scripts and change 'DPPP' to 'DP3'!

Warning: you are using DPPP, the deprecated name for DP3, to start the program!
In March 2021, the main DP3 executable was renamed to 'DP3' to use one consistent
name. Your parameters are now forwarded to DP3, but this forwarding wrapper will be
removed in the future: update your commands/scripts and change 'DPPP' to 'DP3'!

Warning: you are using DPPP, the deprecated name for DP3, to start the program!
In March 2021, the main DP3 executable was renamed to 'DP3' to use one consistent
name. Your parameters are now forwarded to DP3, but this forwarding wrapper will be
removed in the future: update your commands/scripts and change 'DPPP' to 'DP3'!

Warning: you are using DPPP, the deprecated name for DP3, to start the program!
In March 2021, the main DP3 executable was renamed to 'DP3' to use one consistent
name. Your parameters are now forwarded to DP3, but this forwarding wrapper will be
removed in the future: update your commands/scripts and change 'DPPP' to 'DP3'!

Warning: you are using DPPP, the deprecated name for DP3, to start the program!
In March 2021, the main DP3 executable was renamed to 'DP3' to use one consistent
name. Your parameters are now forwarded to DP3, but this forwarding wrapper will be
removed in the future: update your commands/scripts and change 'DPPP' to 'DP3'!

Warning: you are using DPPP, the deprecated name for DP3, to start the program!
In March 2021, the main DP3 executable was renamed to 'DP3' to use one consistent
name. Your parameters are now forwarded to DP3, but this forwarding wrapper will be
removed in the future: update your commands/scripts and change 'DPPP' to 'DP3'!

Warning: you are using DPPP, the deprecated name for DP3, to start the program!
In March 2021, the main DP3 executable was renamed to 'DP3' to use one consistent
name. Your parameters are now forwarded to DP3, but this forwarding wrapper will be
removed in the future: update your commands/scripts and change 'DPPP' to 'DP3'!

Warning: you are using DPPP, the deprecated name for DP3, to start the program!
In March 2021, the main DP3 executable was renamed to 'DP3' to use one consistent
name. Your parameters are now forwarded to DP3, but this forwarding wrapper will be
removed in the future: update your commands/scripts and change 'DPPP' to 'DP3'!

Warning: you are using DPPP, the deprecated name for DP3, to start the program!
In March 2021, the main DP3 executable was renamed to 'DP3' to use one consistent
name. Your parameters are now forwarded to DP3, but this forwarding wrapper will be
removed in the future: update your commands/scripts and change 'DPPP' to 'DP3'!

Initial peak: 22.4 KJy at 217,411
Next major iteration at: 21.28 KJy
Performed 59 iterations in total, 5 in this major iteration with sub-minor optimization.
Stopped on peak 21.08 KJy, because the minor-loop threshold was reached. Continuing cleaning after inversion/prediction round.
Maximum number of major iterations was reached: not continuing deconvolution.

Warning: you are using DPPP, the deprecated name for DP3, to start the program!
In March 2021, the main DP3 executable was renamed to 'DP3' to use one consistent
name. Your parameters are now forwarded to DP3, but this forwarding wrapper will be
removed in the future: update your commands/scripts and change 'DPPP' to 'DP3'!

Warning: you are using DPPP, the deprecated name for DP3, to start the program!
In March 2021, the main DP3 executable was renamed to 'DP3' to use one consistent
name. Your parameters are now forwarded to DP3, but this forwarding wrapper will be
removed in the future: update your commands/scripts and change 'DPPP' to 'DP3'!

Warning: you are using DPPP, the deprecated name for DP3, to start the program!
In March 2021, the main DP3 executable was renamed to 'DP3' to use one consistent
name. Your parameters are now forwarded to DP3, but this forwarding wrapper will be
removed in the future: update your commands/scripts and change 'DPPP' to 'DP3'!

Warning: you are using DPPP, the deprecated name for DP3, to start the program!
In March 2021, the main DP3 executable was renamed to 'DP3' to use one consistent
name. Your parameters are now forwarded to DP3, but this forwarding wrapper will be
removed in the future: update your commands/scripts and change 'DPPP' to 'DP3'!

Warning: you are using DPPP, the deprecated name for DP3, to start the program!
In March 2021, the main DP3 executable was renamed to 'DP3' to use one consistent
name. Your parameters are now forwarded to DP3, but this forwarding wrapper will be
removed in the future: update your commands/scripts and change 'DPPP' to 'DP3'!

Warning: you are using DPPP, the deprecated name for DP3, to start the program!
In March 2021, the main DP3 executable was renamed to 'DP3' to use one consistent
name. Your parameters are now forwarded to DP3, but this forwarding wrapper will be
removed in the future: update your commands/scripts and change 'DPPP' to 'DP3'!

Warning: you are using DPPP, the deprecated name for DP3, to start the program!
In March 2021, the main DP3 executable was renamed to 'DP3' to use one consistent
name. Your parameters are now forwarded to DP3, but this forwarding wrapper will be
removed in the future: update your commands/scripts and change 'DPPP' to 'DP3'!

Warning: you are using DPPP, the deprecated name for DP3, to start the program!
In March 2021, the main DP3 executable was renamed to 'DP3' to use one consistent
name. Your parameters are now forwarded to DP3, but this forwarding wrapper will be
removed in the future: update your commands/scripts and change 'DPPP' to 'DP3'!

Warning: you are using DPPP, the deprecated name for DP3, to start the program!
In March 2021, the main DP3 executable was renamed to 'DP3' to use one consistent
name. Your parameters are now forwarded to DP3, but this forwarding wrapper will be
removed in the future: update your commands/scripts and change 'DPPP' to 'DP3'!
