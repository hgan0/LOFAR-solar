Warning: you are using DPPP, the deprecated name for DP3, to start the program!
In March 2021, the main DP3 executable was renamed to 'DP3' to use one consistent
name. Your parameters are now forwarded to DP3, but this forwarding wrapper will be
removed in the future: update your commands/scripts and change 'DPPP' to 'DP3'!

Warning: you are using DPPP, the deprecated name for DP3, to start the program!
In March 2021, the main DP3 executable was renamed to 'DP3' to use one consistent
name. Your parameters are now forwarded to DP3, but this forwarding wrapper will be
removed in the future: update your commands/scripts and change 'DPPP' to 'DP3'!
